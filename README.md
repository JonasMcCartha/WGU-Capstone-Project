# WGU-Capstone-Project
My capstone project for my bachelor's at Western Governor's University


Run the .jar file in the main directory to open. Use 'admin' for the user and 'password' for the password to get in. 


This a 'Patient Scheduler' desktop application built with Java and JavaFX.  The user can add, modify, and delete patients, create appointments for patients using a calendar GUI, and generate reports for the data.  All patient and appointment data is stored and updated on a MySQL instance running on Google Cloud Platform that I am the sole admin of.  Since this is just a demonstration program and has no real patient data, anyone who uses this program is accessing and can alter the same data as anyone else.

The code shows knowledge of Java and OOP concepts such as MVC(Model-View-Controller) architecture, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, SQL integration, GUI design, proper use of getters and setters, using informative variable names, JUnit testing, and more.  Also included in the main directory are a comprehensive user guide(PatientScheduler Design and User Guide.odt) and a Project Management document which includes the SQL schema(PatientScheduler Methodologies.odt)
You can add, modify, or delete any data to your liking, but please remember that this is a demonstration and test program and you are altering data in the same shared cloud DB that other users will access, so just don't add anything inappropriate or offensive.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.  I have direct access to the database and can create a user for you, if you like, or answer any other questions about the code or SQL schema.
